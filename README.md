## Code of law Redwood county (Rules)

**General Rules**

Welcome to Redwood County!
Our server is mainly focused on RP, we are a semi realistic RP server.
This means Redwood County is its own universe, We have our own 
laws/law enforcement.
(Please remember that our server is PC only!)

We are a multi language server, this means you can talk any language you want with others that can speak the same language.

You must be able to speak fluent english on this server, this is the way everybody will communicate with each other and roleplay with each other.

Do not start RP talking a foreign language, always start it in english and try to get to know them in RP, 

Cursing is allowed in RP, but keep it english so everybody can understand what you're saying.


A working, quality mic is required.
Your character needs to have a somewhat realistic name, and must not break any rules

Being toxic, or breeding toxicity in any channel will get you muted or removed from our community

Be respectful to others,
Racism isn‚Äôt allowed in any way, shape or form.
Sexism isn‚Äôt allowed in any way, shape or form.
Discrimination isn‚Äôt allowed in any way, shape or form.

Abusing bugs / duplicating in any type of way will resort in a perm ban

Use common sense.




**Player Reports and Bans**

These can be posted in game / in our discord  using the /report feature ingame or make a ticket in our discord server. 

Staff will still need the ID (press Z - will be number above their head) of the person who is suspected of breaking a guideline or rule. 

Staff will also actively enforce community rules and guidelines without reports.
In order for staff to enforce rules without reports, we will still need the players ID, which can be gotten by pressing Z.

**In-Game Information**

Stay in character at all times:
In the event there‚Äôs an issue, completely role-play out the scenario and report the player if needed. 

Do not break character / inform the player they are breaking a rule in-game.
Do not do actions in game in order to bait others into breaking roleplay.
(Doing this will result in a 2 hour ban!)

**/OOC usage:

OOC Chat isn‚Äôt meant for chatting or RP, OOC Chat is meant for technical issues only and is for things that cannot be handled in a support channel through discord.


**Server Restarts:**
Roleplay shouldn‚Äôt be stopped or become less serious before a restart; it should continue as normal.

**Loot boxing:**
Looting any player without much roleplay presented for them is prohibited.




**Metagaming:**
Purposely using or relaying information that your character did not learn in-game (Twitch Chats and Discord Channels included) to shape in-game roleplay.

**Powergaming/Fail RP:**

Using means not actually in-game to gain an advantage or not attempting to fit in to the world in a sensible way:
Talking/Organizing/Calling out locations while downed.

Finding the quickest way to make money, rather than roleplaying around the mechanic.

Avoiding the use of ‚ÄúPut in vehicle‚Äù command. Escorting people while in vehicles.
The use of /me should be used as much as possible to help aid your scenarios.

Driving at unrealistic speeds with no character reason over and over.

Government employees not obeying road laws.

**Random Death Match(RDM) & Vehicle Death Match (VDM):**
Attacking another player/group without any story/roleplay leading up to it.
Attacking another player/group using a Vehicle with the intent to kill/knock them out without valid reasoning or initiation.
Speed (100+) attacking other vehicles (Ramming).

**New Life Rule (NLR):**
If you are downed and respawn at the hospital your character forgets the immediate events leading up to being downed in the current scenario. 

You may not respawn if you‚Äôve been advised that police or EMS is on the way to your scene.

You must try and contact medical help of some sort while incapacitated.

**Multiple Characters(from the same player) in one gang/group):**
This is not allowed. In general, try to avoid creating multiple characters involved in the same story/scenarios and could use the same information to push their goals.

**Not Valuing Life (NVL):**
Not realistically fearing for your life when you are threatened with weapons or severe harm from other means.

Having non-spontaneous shoot outs at PD or hospital is not allowed.

Antagonizing gangs/police or armed individuals for no character reason.

Players should not be inserting themselves into ongoing situations or shootouts, between two groups or one group and the police.


**Criminal Activities:**
Criminal activities are limited to 5 players max at a time.
Relaying information to or between characters (lookouts, radio communications) counts you as part of that scenario.

You aren‚Äôt allowed to camp at any drug location ingame.

You aren‚Äôt allowed to hoard guns.
(Max 20+)


You aren‚Äôt allowed to rob Police Officers, EMS

Every robbery needs a plan, Robbing a store/bank/etc without a plan is seen as NVL.

You are allowed to use voice changers if you have a mask or something that conceals your identity. (overly highpitched, Alien voices, unintelligible voices aren‚Äôt allowed)


Whenever characters are brought into police custody and a second group of five is formed to attempt a prison break or transport break, that second group is not allowed to intervene until the prison transport begins. Doing so with small weapons or an unthought out plan is also NVL.

You are not allowed to smuggle items into jail, unless you are participating in a jailbreak.

(The more guns you have the more risk you have of getting raided.)

**Economy:**


Our economy is specially designed to enforce roleplay and to remove grinding a long  time to start any type of RP.

If you join our server with the intent of grinding long hours and farming guns/cars etc  and not participating in any type of RP, we advise you to go somewhere else.

Grinding is strongly discouraged, we encourage players to RP for their money we have designed our Economy system to encourage RP.



**Mic spamming:**
Playing loud music through your microphone is not allowed.

Playing normal music through your microphone is allowed if it‚Äôs done in an RP scenario or to start RP.


**Redwood County**

Our goal is to foster a roleplaying experience free from constraints
We strive to create a fun roleplaying experience for beginner and experienced players

**We hope that everybody has a good time on our server, and we hope to make a difference in the FiveM Roleplaying Community!**
